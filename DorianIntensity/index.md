# On the low-level wind field and maximum intensity of Hurricane Dorian (2019)

## Abstract

An informal yet scientifically guided discussion on the maximum intensity of Hurricane Dorian (2019) is presented, with some comments on the wind speeds experienced in Marsh Harbour, Great Abaco in the Bahamas on 01 September. A variety of datasets are shown and discussed alongside analytical, observational, and numerical studies from tropical cyclone (TC) literature. The purpose of this article is not to diagnose an exact maximum wind speed value to Dorian at any particular time or location, but rather to suggest that the maximum (and Abaco landfall) intensity assessed by the National Hurricane Center (NHC) is valid within acknowledged error bounds in the context of overall TC structure and land impacts.

---

## 1. Context

On 01 September 2019, Hurricane Dorian made landfall in the Abaco Islands in the NW Bahamas, first on Elbow Cay at 16:40 UTC and then on Great Abaco around 18:00 UTC, according to the NHC best track (Avila et al. 2020). This followed a period of rapid intensification of 30 kt in the previous 24 h. The intensity of Dorian at these landfalls was assessed at 160 kt (185 mph). In this article, the term "intensity" will be used interchangeably to refer to maximum sustained wind, with the latter defined by NHC as a theoretical mean value taken at 10 m above the surface over an interval of 60 s anywhere in the storm. For brevity, we will often use the term "surface winds" to refer to those at the conventional 10-m height, though "near-surface" would perhaps be more appropriate. We will also mostly use SI units following standard scientific practice, where 1 m/s ~ 2.237 mph ~ 1.944 kt.

## 2. Automated surface wind analyses

Two objective (i.e., automated) surface wind analyses, HWIND and TCSWA, are shown here for Dorian around the time of landfall on Abaco. Details of the analyses, and by proxy some of their strengths and weaknesses, are examined. This section is intended more as a refutation of a previous claim which used HWIND to justify the maximum intensity and surface wind distribution of Dorian at landfall.

### 2.1. HWIND

HWIND, formerly H\*WIND, is a (now) proprietary product of the risk management and reinsurance company RMS, and so the raw data is unavailable publicly for inspection. Assuming the algorithm itself has not undergone significant changes since it was privatized, HWIND uses the method of least squares and cubic spline interpolation to fit a gridded wind field (the analysis) to the ingested, time-composited observations. The interpolation and compositing also act as a low-pass filter, smoothing out mesoscale and smaller features. The new wind field is enhanced by multiplying by a 1-min gust factor (a value of 1.094 was used by Powell et al. 2010) in the eyewall that exponentially decays with radius to "restore" a value for the 1-min maximum sustained wind.

Figure 1: Publicly released HWIND graphics for (left) 01 Sep. 18:00 UTC and (right) 03 Sep. 00:00 UTC. Retrieved from https://twitter.com/hwind/status/1168237573816430593 and https://twitter.com/hwind/status/1168674508871544837, respectively.

A few graphics for Dorian were released by RMS in near-real time on social media, allowing for limited visual assessment. An example for 01 September 18:00 UTC is shown in Figure 1 (left). As mentioned above, wind maxima associated with convective-scale features, such as rainbands, are nearly completely absent. This has critical implications on the estimation of intensity, which will be explored further below with high-resolution numerical model data. The identified maximum wind speed, given in the graphic, underestimates the best track intensity by about 20 mph. It is plausible that the fitted B-splines for this particular analysis did not accurately capture Dorian's compact eyewall.

Because of the intrinsic smoothing and time compositing, it is more valid to use these analyses in describing the general kinematic spatial characteristics (i.e., storm-scale surface wind distribution), rather than discerning rapidly evolving convective-scale features, let alone the instantaneous maximum wind. For example, Nolan et al. (2021a,b) used H\*WIND in an azimuthal-mean sense to evaluate WRF simulations of Hurricane Wilma (2005), and the reasonably good fit of the wind profiles added confidence to the realism of the simulated time-dependent surface winds as validated by in situ observations. In addition, Nolan et al. (2021a; their Figure 6) noted that H\*WIND diagnosed unrealistic inflow while the vortex was centered over land. While Abaco is certainly smaller than South Florida, and this issue may well have since been alleviated using an updated methodology, the realism of the above 01 September 18:00 UTC analysis could have been slightly affected by land mass.

Lastly, there is the presence of "artifacts" in the analyzed wind fields, here by which we mean topological features resulting from characteristic behaviors of the basis functions. A rather conspicuous case is shown in Figure 1 (right) for 03 September 00:00 UTC, where the surface wind field is distinctly angular, surely an exaggeration of any actual asymmetries (see Figure A1, Appendix, for a comparison to other analyzed wind fields; the HWIND for 02 September 18:00 UTC could be even more egregious but is not shown due to the lack of airborne radar data for comparison). This may have been due to the time-compositing of observations during a period of rapid weakening, along with possibly inadequate weighting of certain input points. Generally, this is not too much of a concern, especially when consulting these analyses as just one component of a broader assessment, but this emphasizes the fact that one must be extremely careful in interpreting these fields, or any other automated product, as a ground truth without understanding their underlying properties or intended use. This especially holds for proprietary data.

### 2.2. TCSWA

Another well-known automated surface wind product in the research and operational communities is the aircraft-based Tropical Cyclone Surface Wind Analysis (TCSWA), produced in real time by Colorado State University's Cooperative Institute for Research in the Atmosphere (CIRA). The TCSWA is a component of the satellite- and aircraft-blended Multiplatform Tropical Cyclone Surface Winds Analysis (MTCSWA), for which the inner core region is heavily determined by SFMR data (Knaff et al. 2015). Compared to HWIND, TCSWA uses a variational technique, minimizing a cost function between observations and a bilinearly interpolated flight-level wind field (the analysis); details are given in Knaff et al. (2011). Smoothness constraints in the optimization problem also act as a low-pass filter. The surface winds are computed using established flight-level reduction factors and parameterized inflow angles, before finally being rotated into earth-relative coordinates. One notable difference is that TCSWA uses greater weights in the azimuthal direction versus H\*WIND (Knaff et al. 2015; Nolan et al. 2021a), giving it a noticeably more circular appearance. Artifacts produced by the analysis include band- or streak-like structures, for example as seen to the NW of the storm in the 02 September 00:00 UTC panel in Figure 2 (bottom right).

![](https://github.com/jyunge/jyunge.github.io/blob/550d28c3535584954db4f7bcbf35e63b508646b4/DorianIntensity/images/tcswa.png)

Figure 2: TCSWA analyses for consecutive 6h times starting from 06:00 UTC on 01 September. Contours are wind speed plotted every 10 m/s. The white dashed curve is the NHC best track with 6h times labeled (unlabeled intermediate points indicate a landfall position). The "+" in the 18:00 UTC plot indicates the location of Abaco Beach Resort, which appears to be over water as the coastline is unresolved there.

Our purpose in showing the TCSWA fields is not to diagnose a value or location of the maximum wind, as many of the points stated above on automated analyses for HWIND also apply here. Unlike HWIND, however, we are able to examine the raw data for all times of interest. As the storm was steadily intensifying up to landfall, it is not surprising to see shifting locations of the strongest winds in the TCSWA fields as portrayed in Figure 2. As will be supported using airborne Doppler radar observations below, there were likely rapidly evolving asymmetries in Dorian's wind field leading up to landfall, therefore precluding any simple or meaningful identification of a singular location of the maximum wind in any mesoscale or smaller sense. In addition, qualitatively examining the 01 September 18:00 UTC TCSWA, also to be supported by radar data, it is argued that Dorian had achieved a very symmetric storm-scale circulation by landfall. The highest winds would then have been present across a wide azimuthal extent in the eyewall, subjecting a large area on the surface to the greatest intensity of the storm, regardless of its exact magnitude. This will also be elaborated on farther below using high-resolution numerical model data.

## 3. WP-3D tail Doppler radar

Here, we examine the derived low-level horizontal wind fields from the NOAA WP-3D aircraft tail Doppler radar (TDR) during the NOAA-tasked reconnaissance mission (190901H1) prior to landfall. The winds are generated using the variational analysis technique of Gamache (1997), which has since been used extensively in observational studies of TC structure and evolution (e.g., Reasor et al. 2009; mathematical details of the algorithm are given in their appendix). The data is publicly available via the NOAA Hurricane Research Division (HRD) TC-RADAR dataset (Fischer et al. 2022) and represent the most accurate, complete observations of the storm's spatially distributed wind field, maybe except for the ground-based Bahamas radar data, whose availability is unknown. Although the TC-RADAR data for 190901H1 has not yet been subjectively quality controlled (P. Reasor, personal communication), for the purposes of short qualitative discussion, the objectively controlled fields are deemed more than sufficient, and anomalies will be pointed out when appropriate.

![](https://github.com/jyunge/jyunge.github.io/blob/550d28c3535584954db4f7bcbf35e63b508646b4/DorianIntensity/images/190901H1_tdr.png)

Figure 3: Reflectivity and derived storm-relative horizontal winds from the TDR at three different heights for each leg during 190901H1. The times indicated in the plot titles are the center fix times given in TC-RADAR. Contours are horizontal wind every 2.5 m/s. The dashed curve and "+" marker are as in Figure 2.

### 3.1. Free atmosphere

Figure 3 shows TDR reflectivity and derived storm-relative horizontal winds at three different heights for each flight leg during 190901H1. (We will often use the term "leg" informally, to describe the swath generated for both the inbound and outbound legs.) At 2 km height (top panels), well above the TC boundary layer, low-wavenumber asymmetries appear in the wind field of Leg 1 (top right). The vertical continuity of these perturbations above 2 km (not shown) provide confidence that the echo sources are coherent and meteorological. As these features are approximately collocated with similar-scale asymmetries in the radar reflectivity, they may be mesovortices associated with barotropic instability (e.g., Schubert et al. 1999, Cha et. al 2020). The TDR data also suggested that these asymmetries may be collocated with regions of elevated relative vorticity (not shown) which would lend even more support to this hypothesis, but we refrain from drawing robust conclusions due to the missing wind (and therefore vorticity) data near the TC center. Note that the asymmetries were presumably rapidly evolving as the TDR scanned over the course of the pass, and so the derived wind fields likely do not reflect real, instantaneous characteristics of any particular mesovortices. These perturbations at 2 km become less apparent over the course of the mission, and by the final leg (top right) a few hours before landfall, the TDR winds indicate a remarkably axisymmetric vortex in the free atmosphere. This overall supports the storm-scale evolution as seen in the TCSWA between 12:00 UTC and 18:00 UTC, with Dorian becoming a highly symmetric TC during landfall. The main feature in the derived earth-relative wind at 2 km height (Figure 4, right) is the wavenumber-1 asymmetry in the northwest quadrant with up to 10 m/s magnitude.

![](https://github.com/jyunge/jyunge.github.io/blob/550d28c3535584954db4f7bcbf35e63b508646b4/DorianIntensity/images/191901H1_1516_earth_rel.png)

Figure 4: TDR-derived earth-relative wind for Leg 3, with plot elements as described in Figure 3.

Interpretation of the wind fields becomes increasingly complicated below 2 km due to (1) decreasing radar coverage (data voids) as a result of contamination by surface clutter and perhaps attenuation, (2) possible anomalous features caused by (1), and (3) the asymmetric features we expect to see in the boundary layer flow, which are hard to decouple from (2). The lateral boundaries of the radar "encroach" on the TC eyewall with decreasing height, and artifacts may arise from the boundary conditions imposed on the analysis. Adverse effects on the derived winds via lateral boundary conditions are compounded by the bottom boundary condition of zero vertical velocity, a second derivative minimization constraint, and anelastic mass continuity constraint. For example, on Leg 1 at 1 km height (left-middle panel), the perturbation in the SW eyewall (near the right-of-flight-track boundary) as seen at 2 km height is absent. Also, on Leg 2 at 1 km height (middle panel), there is an abrupt minimum in the western eyewall, near the right-of-flight-track boundary. Whether these apparent anomalies are real, and perhaps related to the asymmetries seen at 2 km height discussed above, will require more intensive, subjective quality control and/or higher-resolution analysis to determine.

### 3.2. Boundary layer

At 0.5 km height, near the top of the TC boundary layer (Zhang et al. 2011), a characteristic feature in all analyses is the wind speed "bands" in the eyewall along the flight track. Since these appear along-track for each of the three legs at different headings and have a similar characteristic azimuthal length scale in each pass relative to the swath boundaries, the behavior near the lateral edges is likely spurious to some extent. The magnitudes of the (sometimes sharp) accelerations and decelerations in the southern eyewall are quite unrealistic even for jet-like structures (e.g., Kepert 2006a, their Figure 13; Kepert 2006b, their Figure 11), especially for storms as symmetric as Dorian. Nevertheless, examining the winds near the centerline of the swath, which are least affected by the lateral boundary conditions and therefore most likely accurate, it is evident that the highest storm-relative boundary layer winds are in the southern eyewall (including the SW and SE portions, i.e. left-of-motion). This is true for each pass in the mission, and by the final leg, the difference becomes at least 6 m/s. Thus, in the TDR-derived earth-relative wind in the final leg (Figure 4, left), the boundary layer winds are still highest by a small amount (up to 2-3 m/s) in the southern eyewall, but due to the aforementioned coverage issues, we avoid making strong determinative statements on the data.

This maximum in the southern eyewall observed in the final leg, if real, could reasonably be ascribed to a combined effect of the weak but extant environmental shear and the proximity of the land mass of Abaco. The GFS-analyzed shear was 9 kt to the SE at 12:00 UTC weakening and veering to 6 kt to the SSE at 18:00 UTC. The dropsonde composite study of Zhang et al. (2013) showed the deepest and strongest storm-relative inflow in the downshear quadrants and the greatest storm-relative boundary layer tangential winds in the left-of-shear quadrants (in the northern hemisphere), with the strongest downshear-left. These results are supported by the SFMR and flight-level wind-based study of Uhlhorn et al. (2014), and environmental shear was proposed as a cause of the "unusual" boundary layer wind distribution in the case study of Hurricane Isabel (2003) by Schwendike and Kepert (2008). Nonlinear behavior in the boundary layer also stems from the orientation of the shear vector relative to the motion vector, and the time rate of change of each (Uhlhorn et al. 2014; Klotz and Jiang 2017; Ahern et al. 2021). Regarding land interaction, numerous studies of TC boundary layer dynamics near and during landfall (e.g., Kepert 2002, Tang and Tan 2006, Hlywiak and Nolan 2022) have shown that subgradient radial inflow develops on the offshore-flowing side as the TC approaches a land mass. This inflow advects angular momentum toward the TC center as it wraps around to the rear-of-motion side of the TC, and a concomitant boundary layer tangential wind maximum develops toward the offshore-rear (left-rear in the northern hemisphere) of the TC. These idealized results are supported by the comprehensive observational and numerical study of Hurricane Mitch (1998) of Kepert (2006b).

It is entirely possible that the maximum boundary layer winds at the front (western) eyewall of Dorian, where the radar was not able to completely sample at 0.5 km height, were transiently higher than those to the south. We are unable to discern from the TDR data alone how the surface (10 m) wind spatial distribution may have appeared especially in that area due to data gaps, and we again turn to the literature for guidance. Asymmetric friction acts to produce the strongest storm-relative inflow toward the front to front-right of a moving TC (in the northern hemisphere) such that free from other influences, the maximum storm-relative tangential winds are the most supergradient (implications elaborated on below) and lowest in height toward the front-left of the storm (Kepert 2001; Kepert and Wang 2001). In addition, the surface wind reduction factor is greater (i.e., the storm-relative surface winds are less reduced from aloft) toward the front-left of the TC. It is claimed but not explicitly shown in Kepert (2001) and Kepert and Wang (2001) that the strongest earth-relative surface winds are still in the front-right quadrant in their models, though again wind shear and land proximity often dominate over the translational signal (Schwendike and Kepert 2008; Uhlhorn et al. 2014). Lacking a more sophisticated inquiry, we only discuss the mere possibility here, and are not proposing that this (the eyewall winds were strongest at the front) was factually the case.

The boundary layer winds in Dorian may also have been supergradient, and quite possibly strongly supergradient. This is because of Dorian's compact and therefore "peaked" wind profile (e.g., Kepert 2001). The idealized landfall simulations of Williams (2019) also showed that, for a perpendicular landfall along a perfectly straight, homogeneous coastline, the presence of land acts to enhance inflow at the surface at the front of the TC. This generates (or enhances) supergradient winds there, similar to the motion effect described in Kepert (2001), though an island would induce a weaker effect versus a continental-like land mass used in the idealized landfall studies. Obviously, "most supergradient" boundary layer flow does not necessarily imply strongest surface wind (Kepert 2001; Kepert 2001), but the existence of flow imbalance introduces the possibility of asymmetric features in the eyewall associated with dynamical instabilities in the eyewall (e.g., Hendricks et al. 2014), which could have produced locally enhanced surface winds similar to what was seen in Hurricane Harvey in 2017 (Wurman and Kosiba 2018) and Typhoon Goni (Ineng) in 2015 (Mashiko and Shimada 2021). Wu et al. (2009) and Williams (2019) described increased inward advection of (potential) vorticity ahead of a TC approaching land, narrowing the PV annulus in conjunction with the diabatic heating in the eyewall. Whether this modification of the inner core PV increases the chance of barotropic instability is not known to the author, but would be well worth investigating in future research. This effect is surely highly sensitive to topography, among other external factors, and we do not assert that this was indeed the case in Dorian.

To reiterate, the realism of the TDR-derived wind fields must be evaluated using more sophisticated quality control, especially for the low-levels which are heavily affected by data gaps and boundary conditions. The usual caveats of TDR analysis apply here, including sampling lag, time merging, and possible incorrect removal of hydrometeor fall speed. Details of the boundary layer structure and vortex asymmetries in Dorian would benefit from TDR vertical profile analyses, but these require generally more careful interpretation (M. Fischer and P. Reasor, personal communication) and so are not included for now. This section does not intend to use the TDR analyses as an irrefutable truth, nor to determine a particular value or location for the maximum surface wind speed; rather, we provided credible evidence that the boundary layer wind field of Dorian, indeed like in all TCs, was complex and rapidly evolving on hourly (sub-synoptic) time scales. We also presented examples of known asymmetric boundary layer dynamics that may have been present in Dorian. This is because Dorian's circulation aloft was highly symmetric, and so insight can be readily taken (but of course not applied with absoluteness) from studies using composite (axisymmetric) frameworks. Even considering all of the aforementioned, the 2-km grid spacing used to construct the analyses will still not resolve small-scale eddies which contain the strongest winds in a TC (Fischer et al. 2022).

## 4. SFMR and flight-level winds

Data from the Stepped-Frequency Microwave Radiometer (SFMR) instrument aboard the NOAA WP-3D and USAF WC-130 aircraft, in conjunction with flight-level data, are discussed in this section in the form of simple time series. Aircraft data (SFMR, flight-level, dropsondes), when available, are some of the most valuable observations in the NHC's real-time and post-storm determination of TC intensity, and in the case of Dorian, have presented an intriguing yet confounding picture of the surface winds. We offer some general comments that could shed light on this observed behavior.

Figure 5: Flight tracks of the NOAA (190901H1; left) and Air Force (190901U1; right) aircraft reconnaissance flights during Dorian's approach to and landfall on Abaco on 01 September. The points with labeled times (UTC) were subjectively chosen and do not necessarily reflect "official" leg beginning and end times. The gray dashed line is the NHC best track.

All NOAA and Air Force SFMR data are plotted from the publicly available NetCDF files via the NOAA/HRD page for Dorian. Since the flight-level wind variables in the NetCDF files only contained missing values, these data were instead taken from the 1 Hz ASCII files also via HRD. It is uncertain whether the "raw" data in the NetCDF or 1 Hz files have had a 10 s moving mean filter already applied, as Nolan et al. (2014) notes "the surface wind and path-averaged rain rate are simultaneously retrieved at a 1-Hz rate, and retrievals are averaged using a 10-s running mean filter"; this is intended to represent a 1-min mean at a fixed location (Klotz and Uhlhorn 2014). Out of caution, we ran our own 10-s moving mean on the downloaded SFMR and flight-level data, and these are the values shown in the below figures.

### 4.1. NOAA WP-3D

Figure 6 shows a time series of SFMR-measured surface wind speed (blue) and flight-level wind speed (magenta) for each of the three legs from 190901H1. SFMR winds that were flagged as "questionable" are indicated by the red "x" markers (more precisely, the red markers indicate the 10-s moving mean wind at the flagged time). The corresponding WP-3D aircraft track is shown in Figure 5 (left). The most noticeable and intriguing feature in the aircraft data is that the SFMR winds are consistently and often significantly higher than the flight-level winds in the eyewall region, and that these values were unflagged by the automated quality control algorithm(s). This behavior, as has been noted (e.g., E. Blake 2019 via Twitter), is inconsistent with the generally observed relationship between typical flight-level and surface winds; that is, the surface maximum is typically reduced by 80 to 90 percent from the peak 700 hPa wind (Franklin et al. 2003; Powell et al. 2009). In addition, the WP-3D flew approximately along the 750 hPa surface for this mission (Figure 7), meaning that winds at the more standard 700 hPa flight level (approximately 3 km) would show an slightly greater discrepancy from the observed SFMR, since the strength of the primary circulation diminishes with height above the boundary layer following thermal wind balance. The reason the WP-3D flew at a lower altitude was probably because of the concurrent Air Force-tasked mission at 700 hPa, discussed below.

The phenomenon where SFMR winds are similar to or greater than flight-level winds has been observed in previous intense TCs, such as Matthew (2016) (Figure A?; appendix) and Irma (2017) (Figure A#). A well known problem in TC operations and research is quantifying the noted uncertainty, namely a high bias, of SFMR measurements in high wind conditions (see, e.g., Stewart 2021) and at non-ideal sampling conditions (Holbach et al. 2018). Shoaling could also have affected the accuracy of SFMR measurements especially in the later passes and could explain why there was no SFMR data included for the final WC-130 pass (below). The official practice at NHC, at least for Dorian, (E. Blake via Twitter; Avila et al. 2020) is thus to "blend" the maximum SFMR wind speed, maximum flight-level wind speed, and near-surface dropsonde-measured winds, which brought the certainly extreme 80-90 m/s (~180-200 mph) SFMR winds to the currently assessed maximum intensity of 160 kt (185 mph). As mentioned in the NHC report on Dorian, pending a recalibration of the SFMR retrieval algorithm in high wind speeds, the best track intensities may be eventually revised (as well as for other storms).

![](https://github.com/jyunge/jyunge.github.io/blob/550d28c3535584954db4f7bcbf35e63b508646b4/DorianIntensity/images/NOAA_SFMR20190901H1_W_P.png)

Figure 7: 10-s mean flight-level vertical velocity (black) and pressure (red) for the final two passes of 190901H1.

Regardless of the exact value of the maximum intensity, the location of the peak SFMR-sampled wind was found to be in the northern eyewall in the last two passes. This could mean that the TDR-computed boundary layer maximum in the southern eyewall did not extend down to the surface; that the SFMR coincidentally sampled locally higher wind perturbations in the northern eyewall; or there was a combination of these (maybe even among other factors). The first two possibilities were touched on in the above TDR section, but a few more remarks can be made here within some new context. Figure 7 shows the flight-level vertical velocity and air pressure during the final two passes. During the eyewall traversals, the aircraft was subject to extreme turbulence, with upward motion reaching 9-10 m/s. Figure 8 shows essentially the same data as Figure 6 but for the final two legs and with flight-level wind direction also plotted. These violent vertical motions corresponded to sudden shifts (veering then backing) in the wind direction, with two possible instances marked by the black arrows in the figure. Zooming into the plot also shows flight-level wind speed perturbations with similar durations, strongly suggesting these features are similar to the eyewall vorticity maxima experienced in rapidly intensifying Hurricanes Hugo (1989) (Marks et al. 2008) and Felix (2007) (Aberson et al. 2017). Note that in the final pass, the aircraft maintained a constant altitude (Figure A?; Appendix) rather than following the pressure surface. The reason for this is also unknown to the author, but we can surmise that this was due to safety concerns regarding the turbulence that was experienced in the previous passes (cf. Marks et al. 2008, Aberson et al. 2017). How these low-level perturbations may extend to the surface in the form of gusts or sustained winds, as possibly seen in the SFMR data, is an area of active research (e.g., Wurman and Kosiba 2018, Stern et al. 2022).

Before discussing the Air Force WC-130 data, we note that in 190901H1, the maximum flight-level winds were consistently found in the northern half of the storm, and this is generally consistent with the TDR derived wind around this height (Figure 9) after adding the motion vector. Note also that the appearance of the TDR fields at 2.5 km is comparable to the spatial and temporal evolution observed in Figure 3.

### 4.2. US Air Force WC-130

The WC-130 (190901U1; track shown in Figure 6, right) SFMR and flight-level wind, shown in Figure 10, depicts a similar relationship as revealed by the WP-3D data, with SFMR-measured winds again often consistently and significantly higher values than those at flight-level. Thus, while this phenomenon may be a result of bias in the SFMR retrieval algorithm, it is likely not due to error in the instrument itself. To avoid repeating points made above, we will simply point out that (1) the flight-level winds are consistently higher in the northern half of the storm, similar to what was observed from the WP-3D, but (2) this distribution is not reflected in the SFMR data in the third- and second-to-last legs, which were the last with available SFMR data, likely because the final leg was affected by contamination from shoaling. (Again, we use the term "leg" to describe both the inbound and outbound legs together, which for 190901U1 were not necessarily following the same azimuth.) There could be many reasons for this; it is unknown, for example, where the aircraft was located in relation to small-scale structures in the TC eyewall. Looking at the aircraft attitude - for example, whether the plane made any turns to navigate away from turbulent features - could provide insight. This applies for the WP-3D data as well.

Figures 11 and 12 are the same as in Figures 7 and 8, respectively, but for the third- and second-to-last legs from 190901U1. The WC-130 flight-level data is somewhat noisier here than the WP-3D data, but some similar features can be discerned. Like the WP-3D, the WC-130 experienced severe turbulence during the eyewall traversals, apparently including an over -15 m/s downdraft in the inbound inner eyewall around 14:55 UTC, ~13 m/s updrafts in the outbound eyewall around 15:03 UTC, a strong downdraft-updraft couplet in the inbound eyewall pass around 16:21 UTC, and a ~15 m/s updraft in the outbound eyewall pass around 16:27 UTC. These vertical velocity perturbations were accompanied by pressure fluctuations, but more scrutiny is needed to separate any pressure signal from simple changes in aircraft altitude. Vorticity signatures are not as apparent in the wind direction as in the WP-3D data (cf. Figure 8), and more careful inspection is needed to determine if these turbulent features are real and have any relationship to the observed flight-level or SFMR-derived winds. While the magnitude of the maximum SFMR winds in these passes are similar (regardless of whether the maximum value itself is accurate) and therefore supports our prior discussion on vortex symmetry, we must remember that SFMR winds are measured only along a flight track and do not remotely capture an extensive spatial representation of the surface wind field.

Thus, the SFMR and flight-level data reveal curious and notable characteristics of the low-level winds in Dorian during and immediately after its rapid intensification phase on approach to Abaco. We preliminarily, but we believe reasonably, theorize that the unusual observations are a result of an exceptionally strong (supergradient) boundary layer jet and associated mesoscale and smaller perturbations in turn due to two-dimensional (barotropic) and three-dimensional dynamical flow instabilities. A powerful boundary layer jet-like structure was indeed used as a justification for the recent upgrade of Hurricane Ian (2022) to Category 5 intensity for a 6 h period before landfall in southwest Florida (Bucci et al. 2023). Along with studies emphasizing the role of unbalanced low-level dynamics in TC intensification (e.g., Smith et al. 2009), these reconnaissance observations in recent storms suggest that "bottom-heavy" wind (not necessarily mass flux) profiles may be somewhat common, if not very prevalent, in high-end and/or rapidly intensifying TCs. As mentioned above in the discussion on TDR data, investigation of this hypothesis would greatly benefit from careful interpretation of vertical profile analyses. The well documented uncertainty, specifically a high bias, of SFMR retrievals in extreme winds and shoaling also very plausibly returned velocities that were not representative of the brightness temperatures sampled.

## 5. Numerical modeling, turbulence, and undersampling

Some comments on the turbulent structure of the TC boundary layer, and the related undersampling of TC winds via SFMR, are made in this section. TC turbulence is a vastly complex subject and, even for a single storm, deserves a whole treatment in a separate article. Future revisions to this text may include a more detailed and complete summary of the turbulent properties of TCs and applications of the theory to Hurricane Dorian.

Figure 13: Various fields from Cécé et. al (2021), their Figure 3. \[Original caption: "Simulated Irma eye at 830 m scale and at 08:00 UTC (REAL830). (a) Sustained surface winds (m s-1). (b) Sea level pressure (hPa) with simulated tracks and observed radar eye center track. The time interval for all tracks is 5 min. (c) Simulated radar reflectivity (dBZ). (d) Observed radar reflectivity (dBZ)."\]

We'll begin by discussing a storm somewhat analogous to Dorian. Hurricane Irma (2017) rapidly deepened to extreme Category 5 status (155 kt ~ 180 mph ~ 80 m/s) by 18:00 UTC on 05 September, before making landfall on Barbuda at peak intensity around 05:45 UTC on 06 September and then Saint Barthélemy and Saint Martin later that day around 11:15 UTC (Cangialosi et al. 2021). Cécé et. al (2021) performed a large-eddy simulation (LES) of Irma's landfall on the latter two of these islands, which are encompassed in the model by fixed nested domains with grid spacings down to just 30 m. Figure 3 from their study is shown below as our Figure 13, which plots various fields from the simulation and observations.

While their simulated storm has some slight differences compared to the observed - for one, the simulated eyewall shape looks somewhat lopsided in radar reflectivity - the main thing we point out are the eddy features embedded in the eyewall (Figure 13, top left): localized, few-km scale perturbations in the wind field. The existence of turbulent and "coherent" eddy-scale features in the inner core boundary layer is well-known and has been deeply examined (e.g., Nolan et al. 2009a,b, Zhang et al. 2010, Guimond et al. 2018, Wurman and Kosiba 2018). The distinction between quasi-organized turbulence and coherent structures is still a little ambiguous, but nevertheless, it is these features that contain the maximum winds in the TC, as stated several times prior, and that would not have been captured in the automated or TDR derived analyses.
